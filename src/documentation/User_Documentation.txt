Wordfury can be played live at wordfury.org or cloned to a local repository at https://github.com/mgiovenco/word-fury.

To play the game from wordfury.org, click on the "Play" link on the top navigation bar.

This will take you to a loading screen which will then turn into the main page.

You will know you have reached the main page when you see a screen that says "WordFury" and has buttons for play and mute.

If you want to play the game without sound, click on the mute button, as it will not be available on later screens.

To start the game, select the theme you wish to play.

Once you start the game words will start falling from the top of the screen. 

Type the falling words into the text box at the bottom of the screen to earn points. You will receive 10 points for each correct word.

The goal is to type each of the words in the text box before they reach the bottom of the screen. If a word reaches the bottom, you lose 10 points.

If you do not see a blinking cursor inside the text box, you will need to click in the text box before you will be able to type.

You will score points for each word you type properly. Press the enter key to submit a typed word.

You win the game when you score 280 points. You lose the game if the score goes below zero.
