Wordfury can be played live at wordfury.org or cloned to a local repository at https://github.com/mgiovenco/word-fury.

To play the game from wordfury.org, click on the "Play" link on the top navigation bar of the webpage.

This will take you to a loading screen. Here you select the language and read instructions.

Once the page is loaded and you are ready to proceed, click the icon in the corner to continue to the Main Menu.

On the Main Menu you can select the level of difficulty you wish to play.

If you want to play the game without sound, click on the mute button.

To start the game, select the theme you wish to play.

Once you start the game words will start falling from the top of the screen. 

Type the falling words into the text box at the bottom of the screen to earn points. Press enter key to submit your word.

The goal is to type each of the words in the text box before they reach the bottom of the screen. 

Scoring:
+10 points for each correct word.
-5 points for incorrectly typed word.
-10 points if a word reaches the bottom of the screen. 

If you do not see a blinking cursor inside the text box, you will need to click in the text box before you will be able to type.

You lose the game if your score goes below zero.

If you can keep your score above 0 after 280 words have come on screen, you win the game!
