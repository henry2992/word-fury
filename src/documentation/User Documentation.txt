Wordfury can be played live at wordfury.org or cloned to a local repository at https://github.com/mgiovenco/word-fury.

To play the game from wordfury.org, click on the "Play" link on the top navigation bar.

This will take you to a loading screen which will then turn into the main page.

You will know you have reached the main page when you see a screen that says "WordFury" and has buttons for play and mute.

If you want to play the game without sound, click on the mute button, as it will not be available on later screens.

To start the game, click on the play button.

Once you start the game, you will see a text box, a score displayed, and words will start falling from the top.

The goal is to type each of the words in the text box before they reach the bottom of the screen.

If you do not see a blinking cursor inside the text box, you will need to click in the text box before you will be able to type.

You will score points for each word you type properly (hit the enter key to submit a typed word).

If a word hits the bottom, you will lose points.

The object of the game is to get the highest score when the word bank at each level runs out.
